## Detailed Issues Table

| # | Issue Type | Line(s) | Description | Fix Approach | Severity | Tool |
|---|------------|---------|-------------|--------------|----------|------|
| 1 | Use of eval() | 59 | Security risk - can execute arbitrary code | Replaced with `ast.literal_eval()` | CRITICAL | Bandit |
| 2 | Dangerous default value | 8 | Mutable default `logs=[]` shared across calls | Changed to `logs=None` with initialization | HIGH | Pylint |
| 3 | Bare exception | 19 | `except:` catches all exceptions | Used specific `except KeyError` and `except Exception` | HIGH | Pylint/Bandit |
| 4 | File without `with` | 26 | File not properly closed on error | Used `with open()` context manager | MEDIUM | Pylint |
| 5 | Missing encoding | 26, 32 | File opened without explicit encoding | Added `encoding='utf-8'` | MEDIUM | Pylint |
| 6 | Function naming | 8 | `addItem` doesn't follow snake_case | Renamed to `add_item` | LOW | Pylint |
| 7 | Function naming | 14 | `removeItem` doesn't follow snake_case | Renamed to `remove_item` | LOW | Pylint |
| 8 | Function naming | 22 | `getQty` doesn't follow snake_case | Renamed to `get_qty` | LOW | Pylint |
| 9 | Function naming | 25 | `loadData` doesn't follow snake_case | Renamed to `load_data` | LOW | Pylint |
| 10 | Function naming | 31 | `saveData` doesn't follow snake_case | Renamed to `save_data` | LOW | Pylint |
| 11 | Function naming | 36 | `printData` doesn't follow snake_case | Renamed to `print_data` | LOW | Pylint |
| 12 | Function naming | 41 | `checkLowItems` doesn't follow snake_case | Renamed to `check_low_items` | LOW | Pylint |
| 13 | String formatting | 12 | Old `%` formatting instead of f-string | Replaced with f-string | LOW | Pylint |
| 14 | Missing docstring | 1 | No module docstring | Added comprehensive module docstring | LOW | Pylint |
| 15 | Missing docstring | 8+ | No function docstrings | Added docstrings to all 8 functions | LOW | Pylint |
| 16 | Unused import | 2 | `logging` imported but never used | Removed unused import | LOW | Pylint/Flake8 |
| 17 | Spacing | Multiple | Expected 2 blank lines between functions | Added proper spacing (PEP 8) | LOW | Flake8 |
| 18 | Global statement | 27 | Using global variable | Kept but documented (necessary for this design) | LOW | Pylint |
| 19 | No input validation | Multiple | Functions accept invalid types | Added type and value checking | MEDIUM | Custom |
| 20 | Poor error messages | Multiple | Generic or missing error messages | Added specific, helpful error messages | LOW | Custom |
| 21 | Missing main guard | 48 | Code runs on import | Added `if __name__ == "__main__"` | LOW | Best Practice |
| 22 | Logic bug | 14-20 | `removeItem` didn't handle quantities | Rewrote to properly track quantities | HIGH | Custom |
